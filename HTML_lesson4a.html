	<!-- some things to keep in mind:
			1. layout - by default html assumes the browser will do all the necessary layout, i.e. moving things to the next line, etc..  If you see this - everything is on one line in the display.  You can force things to a new line with a <p> (paragraph) or <br> line break tags.

			2. everything is very basic color, size, shape.  There are many ways to change the color, size, etc.. and we'll get to some of that - but this is the basic control and how the browser would draw it.

			3. we haven't tied any logic to anything (other than the onclick method of the button).  we have to use javascript for all that and we'll get to that soon also.. 

			4. the best place to see / try the base-level HTML is at http://www.w3schools.com
